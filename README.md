## Introduction

Facial detection is the process of identifying and locating human faces within images or video streams. It involves analyzing the visual features of an image and determining whether they represent a face. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library that provides various algorithms for image processing and object detection, including facial detection.

This project utilizes OpenCV to perform facial detection on images or video streams. It employs a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces accurately and efficiently. With this project, you can integrate facial detection capabilities into your own applications or use it for educational purposes.
